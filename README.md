# Blabber - "Hi Sally"

## Description

This is a speech recognition application built in Python for learning and demonstration purposes only. Speech recognition is triggered using hotword detection, "Hi Sally".

I'll be building this application in such a way that you can easily plug in and play different speech recognition APIs out there.

You are more than welcome to use this, however, as I have mentioned I have only built this for my own learning and this is not built for commercial use!

*CONTRIBUTION*

I've come from a Java background and I am no expect in Python, hence please forgive me for any mistakes I may have introduced whilst developing this application. That said, you are more than welcome to fork this repo, make any ammendment and submit a pull request.

*WARNING!*

If you are using speech recognition services such as Google or Amazon, please ensure that you check the pricing for it as I hold no responsibility for any costs associated to it.
