# Blabber - "Hi Sally"

## Description

This is a speech recognition application built in Python for my ownlearning and demonstration purposes only. This application is triggered with the use of hotword detection, "Hi Sally".

I'll be building this application in such a way that you can easily plug and play with different speech recognition modules built and maintained by third party..

You are more than welcome to use this, however, as I have mentioned I have only built this for my own learning and this is not built for commercial use!

*CONTRIBUTION*

I've come from a Java background and I am no expert in Python, so please forgive me for any mistakes I may have introduced whilst developing this application. That said, you are more than welcome to fork this repo, make ammendments and submit a pull request.

*WARNING!*

If you are using speech recognition services such as Google or Amazon, please ensure that you check the pricing for it as I hold no responsibility for any costs associated to it.
